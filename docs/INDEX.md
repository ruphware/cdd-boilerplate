# Context for `cdd-boilerplate`

## Executive Summary
This repository is a documentation-first template contract for Chat-Driven Development (CDD): a small, stable set of files and prompts that make repos easier to operate with coding agents.

## How to update this file

Use: `docs/prompts/PROMPT-INDEX.md` as the canonical instruction set for generating/updating `docs/INDEX.md`.

## Template vs project repos

- In this template repo, `docs/INDEX.md` may be a starter stub.
- In repos created from this template, regenerate `docs/INDEX.md` so it reflects the actual codebase.

## Directory Overview

- `AGENTS.md` — agent operating rules (CDD)
- `TODO.md` — execution plan
- `docs/` — documentation system

## Status

This INDEX is currently a starter stub for the template repo. Projects created from this template should regenerate their own `docs/INDEX.md` based on their actual codebase.
