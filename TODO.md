# TODO

This file is the active execution plan.

Rules:
- Write work as **steps**.
- Every step must include:
  - **Automated checks** (exact commands: lint/typecheck/tests/build)
  - **UAT** (manual acceptance checklist)
- Keep it current; archive aggressively.

Archiving:
- When the file becomes long/noisy, move completed sections to `docs/archive/TODO_YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
